submitted review for Personal 1, review recorded BUT after that I can still review Personal 1 but not Group 1
-check review working fine (shows reviews)

for himu, review button only homepage working, table cannot review. BUT after i submitted a review on Personal 1, the problem has reversed to same as daniel.
for daniel, is opposite problem.

average rating is showing fine on homepage and also register session table

AFTER FIX
trainingsession count does not reset to 0 after registeredtraining is deleted.

personal history passed the date cannot check review
since check review condition depend on 'completed' and not date

for member, homepage cannot review (disabled), but history can review (even before reviewing any session)

after review personal 1, still cannot review a different session group 1

after submitting more reviews, check review buttons disappeared.


AFTER ERROR FIX

training history table (personal) cannot edit when session is still in progress
-but after the session is over, can edit (enabled together with check review button)

training history table (group) can edit

for training history table (group), group 1 suppose to have 2 reviews, and group 2 suppose to have 1 review.
-but group 1 is showing the table from group 2.
